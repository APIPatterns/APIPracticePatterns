## Patterns for creating an API Stewardship Practice

Thanks for taking a few moments of your time to stop by this repo where we'll be talking about everything it takes to build and deliver APIs at scale. Patterns have impacted many areas of software development and are a great way to express common ideas. In this repo, we are going to try and use this methodology to express what we've learned as we work to put the tools and processes in place to try and help other developers build and deliver better APIs.These patterns reflect our journey of working to build and deliver cloud APIs and SDKs at scale. They are a key ingredient to how we can scale to deliver thousands of APIs and hundreds of SDKs across the Azure surface area.

We hope these patterns are a starting point for a larger conversation with architects, developers, and managers who are building and delivering a large number of services and struggle with how to scale while still creating a great developer experience.

We have a long way to go and this is definitely a work in progress! In many ways, we are still at the outset of our journey. We are constantly learning, uncovering new requirements, and figuring out what to do with edge cases.

It's our hope that you will join us on this journey. Please share your experiences (and patterns!) through pull requests, add comments through [issues](https://github.com/APIPatterns/APIPracticePatterns/issues), or start a [discussion](https://github.com/APIPatterns/APIPracticePatterns/discussions).

The best place to start is the [introduction](https://apipatterns.github.io/APIPracticePatterns/). As you can tell, we are still building out many of the core ideas. Our goal is for each pattern, e.g. [Roads, Gates, & Roundabouts](https://apipatterns.github.io/APIPracticePatterns/roads-gates-roundabouts), to be a self-contained document that can be read and understood without having to read the other patterns.

However, we also want to make sure that the patterns are connected and that we provide logical path through them. This is, as you can see, a bit of a work in progress. So, if you've got ideas, we are open to suggestions!

Enjoy!
