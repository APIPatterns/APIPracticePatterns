# Patterns for creating an API Practice

This set of patterns is intended for use by Architechts, Developers, and Managers who are building and delivering a large number of services that comprise a platform. These services are built by different, often geo-dispersed teams, with varying levels of skills. Over time, what starts out as an elegant vision of a consistent and beautiful API becomes a hodgepodge of things that look similar but are just different enough to cause friction.


* "Grow an Orchard" -- Stewardship vs. Governance
  * Educate, enable, empower 
* "Design a Hammer" -- Build an API people know how to use just by looking at it
  * Naming
  * Operations (GET, PUT, PATCH, blah blah blah)
  * Structure
  * Return values
* “Measure twice. Cut once” -- API First Design
* "Death by a thousand cuts" -- Strive for consistency across their API surface area 
* " ?? " -- Idiomatic implementations & SDKs
* “Paint by numbers” -- Correctness by construction (Cadl)
* “Blame the tool” -- Linting 
* “Wash-Rinse-Repeat” -- Automation for scale
* “Trust, but verify” -- “Live” validation
  * API drift 
* “Fish where the fish are” -- Deliver the information where it will be used
* "Stop. Drop. And Roll" -- Are you building the right thing?
