# Welcome
## Patterns for creating an API Stewardship Practice

Thanks for taking a few moments of your time to check out this web site. Here we'll be talking about everything it takes to build a practice around designing, building, and delivering APIs at scale.

Patterns have impacted many areas of software development and are a great way to express common ideas. We are going to use this methodology to express what we've learned as we work to put the tools and processes in place to try and help other developers build and deliver better APIs.

We hope these patterns are a starting point for a larger conversation with architects, developers, and managers who are building and delivering a large number of services and struggle with how to scale while still creating a great developer experience.

The best place to start is the [introduction](https://apipatterns.github.io/APIPracticePatterns/). As you can tell, we are still building out many of the core ideas. Our goal is for each pattern, e.g. [Roads, Gates, & Roundabouts](https://apipatterns.github.io/APIPracticePatterns/roads-gates-roundabouts), to be a self-contained document that can be read and understood without having to read the other patterns.

However, we also want to make sure that the patterns are connected and that we provide logical path through them. This is, as you can see, a bit of a work in progress. So, if you've got ideas, we are open to suggestions!

It's our hope that you will join us on this journey. Please share your experiences (and patterns!) through pull requests, add comments through [issues](https://github.com/APIPatterns/APIPracticePatterns/issues), or start a [discussion](https://github.com/APIPatterns/APIPracticePatterns/discussions).

Enjoy!
