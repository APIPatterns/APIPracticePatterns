<sup>How to preview your API</sup>

- Previewing an API is not the same as [testing] (need a page on testing)
- Previewing an API is not the same as *API Validation* [Trust but verify](./trust-but-verify.md)
- Preview should focus on how a developer consumes and uses the API.
- More than just REST, look at multiple languages, ideally one untyped and one type safe (e.g. numbers behave differently)
- Understand how a developer can do your hero scenarios
