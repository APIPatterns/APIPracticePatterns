# Roads, gates, & roundabouts

One of the things we strive for in Azure is a clean, consistent, and intuitive API across the entire set of services. In the early days of Azure, this was a much easier challenge. We addressed it by establishing a Review Board that would approve an API definition before it was allowed to be released. However, we encountered several challenges with this approach. First, Azure continued to grow. It wasn't just that we continued to add more and more services, but the capability--and the API surface area--of existing services expanded. Second, as this growth happened, service teams became larger and more geographically dispersed. Third, service teams viewed this as a check box--a step in the process necessary for a release. This meant that when service teams came to a review, it was *at the end* of their development cycle.

These challenges made it difficult for them to incorporate recommendations and changes that would significantly improve the API and overall developer experience. Creating an approval gate that teams had to pass through before they could release their service resulted in constantly creating exceptions, inconsistent APIs, and more importantly frustration for everyone involved. While a review board was good in theory, in practice it just didn't work. We needed to find another way.
