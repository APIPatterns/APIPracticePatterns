Patterns have impacted many areas of software development and are a great way to express common ideas. In this repo, we are going to try and use this methodology to express what we\'ve learned as we work to put the tools and processes in place to try and help other developers build and deliver better APIs.These patterns reflect our journey of working to build and deliver cloud APIs and SDKs at scale. They are a key ingredient to how we can scale to deliver thousands of APIs and hundreds of SDKs across the Azure surface area.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"keep-good-records":{"id":"keep-good-records","title":"keep-good-records","description":"* Architectural logs","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"look-before-you-leap":{"id":"look-before-you-leap","title":"One way to skin a cat","description":"How to preview your API","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"native-tongue":{"id":"native-tongue","title":"Native Tongue","description":"Idiomatic SDKs","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"one-way-to-skin-a-cat":{"id":"one-way-to-skin-a-cat","title":"One way to skin a cat","description":"Create a style guide","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"read-the-fine-print":{"id":"read-the-fine-print","title":"Read the fine print","description":"APIs are contracts","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"references":{"id":"references","title":"References","description":"Fragaszyetal","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"roads-gates-roundabouts":{"id":"roads-gates-roundabouts","title":"Roads, gates, & roundabouts","description":"One of the things we strive for in Azure is a clean, consistent, and intuitive API across the entire set of services.
